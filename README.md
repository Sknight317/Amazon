# Amazon

    This is an app where I created an Amazon-like store front. I used inquirer, my MySQL, and console.table to put the app together. I used  MySQL to create a database of different products. I also included the prices for each product and how many of each product was available in the database. The node application that I created prints the table, from the database, to the console. Using inquirer, the app then asks the user what product they would like to buy and how many of the product they would like to purchase. The app then checks the database to see if there is enough stock left to complete the customer's order. If there is not enough stock left, then the app will alert the customer and tell them there is an insufficient quantity left. If the store does have enough stock of the product the customer wants, then the customer's order will be fufilled, the MySQL database will be updated with the correct quantity, and the customer will be shown the total cost of their purchase.
